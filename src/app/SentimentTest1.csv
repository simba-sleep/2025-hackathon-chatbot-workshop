10M,"It wasn't for me, but great return experience","Well, I will start off by saying that the Casper Original is way more firm than I was expecting. Moving from a softer bed to this one I was expecting an adjustment period and I knew I wouldn't write a review until after 30 days. First, my back was okay for the first 3-4 days as I slept on the mattress but with each passing day after that my back pain got worse and worse. Also, this mattress slept like a furnace. I am typically a hot sleeper and the cooling features that they advertise in their Airscape foam didn't work for me. The last all foam bed I had, actually had cooling gel beads in the top gel memory foam layers and I slept perfectly cool on it in a 70 degree room with an overhead fan on high. With the Casper Original, I had to add a table fan to my nightstand that was constantly blowing (not oscillating) on the mattress in order to keep me cool at night that's how hot I would get when I slept. So, if temperature is a problem for you I would recommend going with one of their beds that has the new Snow technology in it. If you are used to a soft bed and that sink in feeling, the Casper Original is not for you. It is like a neutral foam on top and I feel that I slept more 'on top' of the mattress then in it. I would have some shoulder pain in the mornings but it would go away like within 15 minutes. So, it is a pretty decent mattress for side sleepers. The return process was great though. You have to wait the 30 days before you can return it but it took about a week for me to initiate the return, have it picked up, and have my refund show up in my account. Will depend on your bank as to how fast the refund comes in. All in all it was a great customer experience with Casper even if the mattress was not for me.",3,44376,A. W.,a.-wolf@gmail.com,,,NO,

By the time we realized and decided to call back to return, were past the 100 days which in fact was 6 days beyond. They refused to return and provide any alternate.

I have bad lower back pain and she has upper back/ shoulder pain and a stiff neck every day. We are stuck with a bad mattress and Casper will not do anything to help us, not even a partial refund or exchange.

My Tempur-Pedic salesman explained that Tempur-Pedic now makes Firm mattresses with 100% Memory Foam. Two days after buying this mattress, my back ache disappeared. It is now three months after my purchase and this mattress still provides fantastic support. I strongly recommend people suffering back ache should buy a Firm Tempur-Pedic mattress!",5,44204,Thankful S.,anonymous@gmail.com,,,NO,
11861M,Best Mattress I've ever slept on,"To be completely honest when I walked into the mattress store and saw the prices of these mattresses I was ready to walk out and get something more affordable. I purchased a brand new mattress about 3 years prior and since the day I bought it I've woken up in pain everyday and I didn't want to go through that again with a mattress that was more than 3 times the price I paid for my current mattress. After speaking with the sales person about return options and warranties I finally took a crowbar to my purse and bought the mattress. Let me tell you, this is the best mattress I've ever slept on. I wake up every morning and feel great. No more pain or numbness. No more getting massages because my back and shoulders are killing me. This mattress has changed my quality of life so much that if I knew then how great I would feel each day by changing the mattress I sleep on, I wouldn't have thought twice about the cost. You spend probably about a third of your life in you bed, do yourself a favor and spend the extra money and get a quality mattress because it really makes a huge difference.",5,44204,Well R.,anonymous@gmail.com,,,NO,

We are using the bed for last 3 weeks and I feel its not as firm as I would like my bed to be. If this is the most firm mattress, I think I'll have to reconsider. For me, its a little too soft..",3,44145,Aditya,aditya@gmail.com,,,NO,

12M,I bought the original mattress in twin size,"I did like the unboxing experience, And like the feel off the Casper mattress so far..
but must say that it is about 2' smaller than my previous mattress, I can see it as we have a king size bed frame with 2 twin size mattress on it so my husbands side is longer,
I gave it 3 stars..... as I fond the mattress to be much warmer... than my old one, I bought it because it was advertised as it was cooler over all ...But I do not find that at all ...I will try to get used to it as it has only been 11 nights so far, but if the nights get warmer (we sleep with the windows open so the room is cool) I still have 89 nights to try, I mite send it back, as the warmness off the bed is a deal breaker for me Catharina",3,43966,Catharina R.,catharinarous@gmail.com,,,NO,
12M,Not worth full price,"The box is very heavy, it’s a 2 person job but there’s only handles for one. It has a weird smell to it, probably the foam? I’ve had it for about 6 months now and still every time I take the sheets of to wash I can smell it. I bought a queen at Costco for cheaper than what it is on here and all I can say is I wouldn’t spend full price. Yes the mattress is comfy right away until about hour 5 of sleep. After hour 10 my lower back pain is pretty bad, I am a side sleeper. When I do sleep on my back though it’s pretty good.

12M,Room for improvement,"It took a month to get the bed and that had tainted my experience entirely. I know, Covid reality and the racial tensions had something to do with the delay, so I shouldn’t be too upset. I am not. The fact that Casper didn’t reach out in a more proactive way and that it took so many attempts to properly deal with the delay is the reason for two stars. I haven’t slept on the mattress long enough to assess it properly at this time. But it is not as firm as I thought it would be.",2,44016,Dario,dario@gmail.com,,,NO,
12M,Definitely Glad I Bought The Casper Wave Hybrid,"My wife and I have been thinking for awhile about replacing our 15 year old King mattress with a foam mattress of some sort. After researching and going into a Casper store to try a variety of their mattresses, we decided to purchase the Casper Wave Hybrid King when it was on promotion and boy are we glad we did. Haven't slept so well in a long time. The mattress definitely provides a lot of support for your back which is important for us as we start getting into our senior years. Also, the bounciness of the mattress is quite good so if I move around, it doesn't affect my wife at all. Definitely a mattress I would purchase again.
Since it was a King mattress, XPO took care of the delivery (I understand they take care of all the King mattress deliveries). There were some issues with XPO Logistics/Courier not providing the in-home setup which came with the purchase and they did not take away our old mattress as they were supposed to. As well, XPO did not contact me the day before the scheduled delivery to provide the 4-hour delivery window so I ended up having to call them on the day of the delivery to get the 4-hour window and even at that, they arrived 1.5 hours before the delivery window when we weren't home (Luckily my son was at home). XPO also did not bring the new Casper mattress to our bedroom which is upstairs but left it in our main level hallway.
I called Casper customer service about these delivery issues and the service they provided was outstanding. They arranged to have 1-800-Got-Junk to pick up the mattress the following day and offered to have someone come out to do the in home setup. The Casper support team also contacted XPO about these issues as I got a follow-up call from XPO trying to arrange a time to have the old mattress taken away. The Casper customer support team really bent over backwards to ensure I was satisfied which I appreciated.
Even though there were these delivery issues, I'm still providing 5 stars because the mattress is so good and the Casper customer support team was excellent.",5,44198,Ed C.,edchin@gmail.com,,,NO,

12M,Mattress has issues,"I have now bought two Casper mattresses. The first one was a queen, the second was a twin. 

Both mattress tend to move or slide off the bedsprings. Every morning I have to push it back into place. The queen is especially hard to move.

Another problem is the design of the matress cover. It has a 1/2 inch cord or rope that runs along the top of the mattress. The covers have tended to move and now are lopsided on the mattress. It is impossible to move the covers back into place.

The mattress sleeps well, but be prepared for issues.",2,43949,Glenn H.,glennhanson@gmail.com,,,NO,

Crazy spending this amount of money on sheets (to be honest I was like hmmm that is a lot) but I got him with the ""if we do not like them we can send them back"" let's just say we won't be sending them back he woke up after two nights and was like well worth the money!

12M,Overrated,"I originally had the Essential (it had zero support, sank right down to the base layer) - contacted customer support..they were great! Told me the original would be better for me and they organized the switch. 

I really found this mattress to be painful. I'm a strict side sleeper, average weight. It gave me horrible hip, back, neck and shoulder pain. The zoned support just wasn't effective for me - it made me into this bowed elbow macaroni shape because my hip area was up higher than my feet and head. This may work better for someone very light or heavier. Also, the smell would not dissipate. It made me extremely dizzy, nauseous and I had a headache - as soon as I got the mattress out of my room, the problem was gone. I had really good customer service until I had to return the Original. Right down to major mishaps with the mattress pickup with 1800GOTJUNK - even they were confused.",1,44010,Sara,sara@gmail.com,,,NO,

142233M,Distinction Series Denise Series,"I have only had the mattress for about a week; so far it is comfortable and is on the softer side.
The reason we are only giving 2 stars, is due to issues with the ""Green Glove Delivery"" option that we opted for. The deliverymen dropped the mattress off their truck and DRAGGED the mattress on the rough asphalt driveway and concrete pavers on the front of the property. Even though the mattress had a plastic covering, it could have easily been torn through the plastic sheet and damaged. The mattress cover picked up slushy ice, salt, and debris while being dragged, which was then again dragged on my brand new home's hardwood flooring. Lastly, when bringing the mattress up to the bedroom, the ceiling in a couple locations was scraped. 
Unfortunately, we can not recommend this delivery option, as the delivery personnel do not show the proper care to both the product being delivered, and the client's property.",2,44943.709,Dani F.,danif940@hotmail.com,,ECOM25060526,YES,Desktop

142333M,Distinction Series Ellen Series,"I have only had the mattress for about a week; so far it is comfortable and is on the softer side.
The reason we are only giving 2 stars, is due to issues with the ""Green Glove Delivery"" option that we opted for. The deliverymen dropped the mattress off their truck and DRAGGED the mattress on the rough asphalt driveway and concrete pavers on the front of the property. Even though the mattress had a plastic covering, it could have easily been torn through the plastic sheet and damaged. The mattress cover picked up slushy ice, salt, and debris while being dragged, which was then again dragged on my brand new home's hardwood flooring. Lastly, when bringing the mattress up to the bedroom, the ceiling in a couple locations was scraped. 
Unfortunately, we can not recommend this delivery option, as the delivery personnel do not show the proper care to both the product being delivered, and the client's property.",2,44943,Dani F.,danif940@hotmail.com,,,NO,

14BIOSFTPIL,So soft,I ordered 2 different pillows as best I could online without going into the store and the only way I knew which one was based on the reviews. I really wish they would state soft and firmness on their site. This pillow is extra soft. I ordered the back stomach as I heard a few people say the side sleepers were high and I am a small person. I wish I would have done the side sleeper but no way of knowing. At first your head feels great but it does sink a bit. The smell is not bad at all but I did let it rest for a couple days. After a couple days of use I’m starting to really like it. It’s heavy and feels like it will hold up for a long time. I would recommend.

Ever since I started to use Bio-Soy pillow, I have not experienced those painful neck problems. I highly recommend this type of pillow to people who typically use computer intensively or binge watch Netflix for a long period of time during the day or in the evening. Exercise is important, but the pillow helps a lot. Make sure what kind of sleeper you are - Side or Back (thickness varies between the two), before getting the right pillow.

15POLARPIL,Sturdy!,The king size pillow is so huge my pillowcases barely fit it. It is quite sturdy/heavy. It’s not squishy or soft but rather quite a firm pillow but you really do get used to it and there’s no having to adjust it through the night. My husband is a back sleeper and I’m a side and stomach sleeper and it works well for both of us. I would purchase again but only if on sale.,4,44232.01571,Susan K.,keptwoman1@hotmail.com,,ECOM13679045,YES,Mobile
15POLARPIL,hate this pillow!!!!,"I really hate these very expensive pillows. This is false advertising, they are not cool on one side & warm on the other & extremely uncomfortable. Buyer beware, once they have your money & you complain, they don't want anything to do with you. I called & spoke to a man named Steven complaining about these defective pillows & requested my money back. He said he didn't think they gave refunds on pillows but he would have to check & call me back. First of all, he should know the policy & second of all HE NEVER CALLED ME BACK!!! In addition to me purchasing a horrible product, the customer service is just as bad. My advise, don't ever buy a pillow from Sleep Country unless you go into the store & check it out. You can't go by the description they provide in their website since it is not accurate.

I kept falling back to sleep because they are that comfortable.

Although I couldn't feel the same cool as I could without the covers on, I didn't get all sweaty like I normally do. My hair is often sweaty in the night, but the cooling pillow must alleviate this even though.

15POLARPIL,Not as pleased as I hoped...,"While the pillows did seem to help me with a stiff neck issue I was having, I do find them extremely firm and heavy, these pillows can do some serious damage in a pillow fight. They're supposed to be for ""All Sleepers"" but I find that when I'm on my stomach, I need to place my head more to the edge of the pillow, otherwise, my head will be too high, sometimes I just have to adjust and sleep on my side or back because of it. Forget about hugging or putting these pillows on your head, way too hard and heavy, they almost feel like they can be couch seats. However, as I mentioned, they did seem to have helped me with a major stiff neck issue I had that was giving me major headaches, and I do like the cool side, especially with the weather being so hot these passed few nights. So for now, I'll keep using them, but considering I paid approximately $200 for the pair (Buy 1 get 1 free), at 100$ a piece, I wish I was more satisfied with them.

Nope... But for the price, you won't find better 

As someone who commonly has lower back pain issues, I've been using this mattress for nearly a month and every sleep has been comfortable and I've not been waking with back pain.
 It's not the kind of mattress you lie on and feel like you are on clouds, but for a good, solid sleep and waking up pain free, this was a great choice for me. 

Those $2k+ mattresses may make you feel like you are in paradise but you pay dearly for that luxury. This is a mattress you can be well-rested with at a fraction of the cost of a luxury bed.

162161M,Excellent for the price point,"Is it the best bed I've ever slept on?
Nope... But for the price, you won't find better 

As someone who commonly has lower back pain issues, I've been using this mattress for nearly a month and every sleep has been comfortable and I've not been waking with back pain.
 It's not the kind of mattress you lie on and feel like you are on clouds, but for a good, solid sleep and waking up pain free, this was a great choice for me. 

Those $2k+ mattresses may make you feel like you are in paradise but you pay dearly for that luxury. This is a mattress you can be well-rested with at a fraction of the cost of a luxury bed.

162162M,Skeptical at first but WORTH IT,"went into sleep country to purchase a coiled mattress due to the belief that all of my back issues were due to not having enough springs. I had done so much research into the beauty rest bed that I wanted to purchase I was dead set on it, sure enough I went into sleep country and told them about the cervical pain I was getting in my upper vertebrae which was really affecting me as a nurse and the sales suggested the cloud. To me at first I thought that they may have been trying to sell me this bed because it is a sleep country brand, however once I tried it out I instantly fell in love. I was still skeptical however since my fiancee does not like foam mattresses, however I paid the deposit and my fiancee came in to try it as well the following day just in case since he generally hates foam. 

Within the day he decided he loved it and we both went in and got it delivered within 24 hours! I never thought I would ever go with foam but this matress is so much more then just foam. For the first time in 5 years I no longer have pain in my neck and woke up feeling so refreshed. 

The only con about this bed is the fact that you may sleep past your alarm. Absolutely love it and it by far is the best mattress for the price it is, also at this time of year there is so many sales going on with the cloud.

162162M,Bloom Cloud King Mattress,"I have always wanted a king size mattress and finally ordered the bloom cloud. It arrived nicely packed in a box with 2 small wheels conveniently built into the bottom of the box to act like a dolly . The mattress is soft like a cloud but also supportive. I found that the mattress supports a sore muscle in such a way that you no longer feel the discomfort as you would on a regular mattress. My spouse told me he no longer feels me tossing on this mattress. It just doesn't bounce around. Overall, its great value and a great sleep.

162162M,BLOOM CLOUD MATTRESS,I have had my Bloom Cloud mattress (QUEEN Size) for a littler under a month. Going from a spring coil mattress to Bloom was a very necessary upgrade. The Mattress is definitely great if you have back issues as I feel it aligning my spine. right now I would give it 4/5 stars as i am still testing it out but definitely recommend this. Make sure to do your research between all Bloom beds before buying as the price does vary based on specific features. - J Green,4,44970.75513,Justin G.,justin.green@hotmail.ca,,ECOM25422547,YES,Desktop

For the most part I've slept fairly well since receiving this mattress and for an insomniac, that's pretty good. I just wish that it was a few inches thicker as I prefer the height of my old bed. Since this one is not as thick, it makes for a lower bed and that makes it a bit more difficult for getting in and out of for a person of my age.

162162M,Skeptical at first but WORTH IT,"went into sleep country to purchase a coiled mattress due to the belief that all of my back issues were due to not having enough springs. I had done so much research into the beauty rest bed that I wanted to purchase I was dead set on it, sure enough I went into sleep country and told them about the cervical pain I was getting in my upper vertebrae which was really affecting me as a nurse and the sales suggested the cloud. To me at first I thought that they may have been trying to sell me this bed because it is a sleep country brand, however once I tried it out I instantly fell in love. I was still skeptical however since my fiancee does not like foam mattresses, however I paid the deposit and my fiancee came in to try it as well the following day just in case since he generally hates foam. Within the day he decided he loved it and we both went in and got it delivered within 24 hours! I never thought I would ever go with foam but this matress is so much more then just foam. For the first time in 5 years I no longer have pain in my neck and woke up feeling so refreshed. The only con about this bed is the fact that you may sleep past your alarm. Absolutely love it and it by far is the best mattress for the price it is, also at this time of year there is so many sales going on with the cloud.

Last night was my first night, but so far so good. I had a great sleep and did not wake up once feeling the old, familiar pressure on my hips. A heavier person may need to go to one of the thicker, more expensive models, but this one seems great so far. The 100 night guarantee was a huge selling point too. If I find that this one isn't thick enough, I can return it and put the money towards one of the higher quality models.

162164M,Terribly uncomfortable but still 4 stars...,"Purchased this mattress after reading all the glowing reviews and I gotta be honest with you - I hated it. I hated it the first night, and more with each passing night. For the first time in my life, I had a night of full blown insomnia. I couldn't sleep - I found the mattress soft ish but yet it made my arms and shoulders ache from pressure (and I'm otherwise healthy, young and have no joint issues). I woke with headaches when I did actually sleep. I read that it can take 1-2 wks for your body to adjust to a foam mattress but seriously. Who has the luxury of not sleeping for 1-2wks? I don't. I entertained the idea of returning the mattress but it was the only mattress in my price range and it would cost an extra 50 bucks to have them pick it back up to exchange it. So, I tried the next best thing. I went to Costco and bought a 3 inch gel memory foam topper. The bed went from zero to hero in a matter of seconds. This is now the best bed I've ever slept on.. Even better than a tempurpedic I once had the opportunity to enjoy. The best part, and the main reason for my 4 star review, my asthma has completely disappeared. The foam is hypoallergenic and for the first time in my life I am free of any asthma symptoms. If the bed is in your price range, and it is a little firm for you, just get a topper for it and you will sleep in bliss.",4,43849,Angela B.,angiecbailey16@gmail.com,,,NO,

I hated it the first night, and more with each passing night. For the first time in my life, I had a night of full blown insomnia. I couldn't sleep - I found the mattress soft ish but yet it made my arms and shoulders ache from pressure (and I'm otherwise healthy, young and have no joint issues). I woke with headaches when I did actually sleep. I read that it can take 1-2 wks for your body to adjust to a foam mattress but seriously. Who has the luxury of not sleeping for 1-2wks? I don't. I entertained the idea of returning the mattress but it was the only mattress in my price range and it would cost an extra 50 bucks to have them pick it back up to exchange it. So, I tried the next best thing. I went to Costco and bought a 3 inch gel memory foam topper. The bed went from zero to hero in a matter of seconds. This is now the best bed I've ever slept on.. Even better than a tempurpedic I once had the opportunity to enjoy. The best part, and the main reason for my 4 star review, my asthma has completely disappeared. The foam is hypoallergenic and for the first time in my life I am free of any asthma symptoms.

162164M,Bloom Mist,"We both love this mattress. Up until now my husband and I couldn't agree on a mattress. Either I loved it and he didn't or he liked it and I didn't or we both hated it. 
Along came Bloom. We'd never bought a mattress in a box before but decided to take the leap considering the excellent reviews, good price and return options. We were fed up with waking up with sore backs from our not very old and very expensive mattress.
The set up of the Bloom was a breeze and it's been all good ever since. It's comfortable, supporting and great for both sleeping and sitting up reading. We encourage all our friends and family to try one. We're thankful for it every morning and every night.",5,43478,Susan T.,macfadyen07@hotmail.com,,,NO,

The mattress holds is shape with no indents manifesting.
I tend to run cold and this mattress is so snuggly, I feel warm in it, which is amazing for me. My flannel sheets fit on it perfectly and it is about the same thickness as my former spring mattress. 
This was a great purchase, I am trying to get my parents to buy a foam mattress and finally say good-bye to spring mattresses. 
Finally, I wish they were made in Canada - this is really the big drawback. If I had realized they were made abroad before purchase, I may have went with another brand, which is Canadian made. This is why I took away a star in its rating.",4,44360,Nicole M.,anonymous@example.com,,,NO,

When I am laying on it, I feel somehow my head is in a reclining position facing the floor.

The mattress holds is shape with no indents manifesting.
I tend to run cold and this mattress is so snuggly, I feel warm in it, which is amazing for me. My flannel sheets fit on it perfectly and it is about the same thickness as my former spring mattress. 
This was a great purchase, I am trying to get my parents to buy a foam mattress and finally say good-bye to spring mattresses. 
Finally, I wish they were made in Canada - this is really the big drawback. If I had realized they were made abroad before purchase, I may have went with another brand, which is Canadian made. This is why I took away a star in its rating.",4,44360,Nicole M.,radiateattract@yahoo.ca,,,NO,

16GELP,Smells too horrible to recommend,"Do not buy!
This pillow is very comfortable, but who cares as it carries a horrible moldy smell that will keep you awake! 
The smell is so strong that my husband thought there was a leak in the wall and was ready to call accompany to see if we had mold damaged. After, we identified the smell was coming from the pillow, I called customer service, but they said there was nothing they could do and the smell was from chemicals used in the pillow. The recommend we air it out and said it would take about a week for the smell to dissipate.

I was not impressed with that answers as, Nobody wants to smell chemicals before going to sleep. If the smell is that strong, Sleep Country should air out the pillow before selling it to customer. Many people have sent issues and should be warned if there will be a lingering smell after the purchase. I got this in store and if I would of been warned about a chemical smell, I would not of purchase this pillow!

Anyway, we securely left the pillow out on our balcony all night in a very windy night hoping that would help....it did not. 3 weeks later the smell is still there and we don't use that pillow anymore as it is USELESS to us.

We had a previous order of a Bloom mattress topper but felt it had lost firmness so replaced it. Feb. 13 we placed the order and verified our delivery address. Feb.14 email from Sleep Country verifying shipping address and delivery by Purolator. Feb. 21 received phone call from Wabamum Pharmacy that my order was ready for pickup. This location was a 60 kms. round trip for us. Feb. 21 I called Sleep Country Customer Service and my conversation with Bryan ended with Sleep Country providing a home delivery by Purolator or a pick up for refund. March 10 I received a 2nd call from Wabamum regarding my order. March 10 I called Sleep Country again and had an unpleasant conversation with Renalee who stated she would look into it and call back that day or following Monday. Again,no communication. In order to avoid any issues with our nearest neighbour , the pharmacy, we made the decision to travel the 60 kms. to pick up the order. The largest insult to this issue was the email from Purolator that the delivery had been made. I am very disappointed with Sleep Country and hope that our King Bloom Mattress and the 2nd Bloom Mattress topper outlasts our need for a quality mattress since we are so disappointed with our communication experience.",3,45012.69539,Margaret R.,mjreid@telus.net,,ECOM25769117,YES,Desktop

17ENCASE12,Keeps It Clean!,"This mattress cover is light weight and was easy to put on. I feel it will keep the mattress nice and clean and new looking. The only cons are that the zipper tab slipped off the end while we were opening the cover. Luckily, we were able to put it back on. Make sure you don’t zip it open past the velcro corners. The other con is that the cover is baggy on my mattress. I had to cover it with another tight fitting mattress cover so that the sheets wouldn’t slide around. To me this is OK because the top mattress cover comes off easily for washing while the new one, which encases the whole mattress, would be hard to remove for regular washing.",4,44141.83641,Diane H.,mail@dianehart.ca,,ECOM11105470,YES,Mobile

17MF,Microfiber Essential Sheet Set.,"Right, I don't usually do reviews but, these sheets are very good.

I've always slept on cotton/linen sheets. It's what Mom put on my bed while growing up so you think that is the right choice going forward. OK, typical fare for most everyone but they (the sheets) always ended up moving around and getting bunched up. If you are a warm body at night it's the norm. Kinda sucks having the sheets sticking to you in summer heat right? So you get fans and crank the AC.

Well, I started using microfiber cleaning clothes around the house for dusting and so on, then thought, hmm, this is interesting fabric. I wonder if some company makes bedsheets out of this? Found bamboo fabric sheets. Ummm? Not so much, actually worse than cotton. Bamboo is great for cutting boards and panda bears but not for sheets. So about a month ago I decided to hunker down on research (I literally am a scientist so it's what I do), and found that microfiber sheets exist. Not really surprised but, OK, get some and see what they are like. Many available from Amazon or alibaba or wherever. That's not what I'm after. Long story short, I found a set of Queen-size microfiber sheets at Sleep Country for about 50% off on a Black Friday dealio. Why not try these? If I don't like them, I can send them back. Well, I have them, used for about a month, and I'm keeping them. No shirt, it makes a big difference. We al need to sleep. It rejuvenates us. So sleep hard. These sheets help with that. Whatever else you do on the sheets, happy happy! Be well mi amigos.",5,44555.37258,Barry B.,barry.browne1@gmail.com,,ECOM19396954,YES,Desktop

18ADSIDEPIL,Headaches b' gone!,"As the saying goes, if you have a $10 head, then get yourself a $10 pillow!

I realised I was getting more and more headaches and my old pillow had gone to rest with some clouds in the sky. Time for a new one. We all know the drill, you go to a store and there's hundreds of different types. They all seem to feel right - because usually the only way to test them is to squeeze them with your hands. I don't know about you...but that's not how I sleep. Anyway, like me, you bought what you thought was a good pillow. I was extra happy as there were two in the pack. Alas, the headaches continued and it was destroying my productivity and general enjoyment of life.
Then I read up and bought the Tempur-Pedic Adapt pillow. Oh my goodness. It is amazing! It's like flights of angels gently hold your head as your peacefully sleep.
Because of the memory foam, it's like having a brand new perfectly molded pillow waiting for you every night. No more headaches, just comfortable, cool sleeping.
Whether you can buy one today, or budget for one in the future, do it. I mean.....you don't have a $10 head do you?",5,44234.74313,Raymond B.,raylbry@gmail.com,,ECOM13674859,YES,Desktop

Firstly the online the colour looked like it would be charcoal but it is beige. Secondly it does not have a closure to keep the pillow in place once in the case. Any pillow case I have has extra fabric that allows you to tuck in that encloses the pillow. Some other silk pillow cases I have seen online have a zipper.

I’d like to return or exchange it but sleep country won’t do that on any opened product. While I can understand that policy with sheets and pillowcases, it makes no sense with something like this blanket that might take some experience to get right. Of course when you buy the blanket they don’t tell you you can’t return it once it’s opened. So almost 300 later and I’m stuck with a very heavy, too small item that’s mostly useless!

One point to note is that the material is like a smooth tweed fabric, so the headboard had some mild creasing when first unboxed.

22002M,Comfiest Sleeps,I've been on a hunt for a mattress over the last two years that would best suit my sleep needs. I was hesitant on moving away from a traditional coil mattress to any hybrid/ foam mattresses but I'm so happy I did it! Simba's quality of mattress has everything that you want. I usually wake up with a sore lower back and I haven't had that since getting my Simba. Ordering process was seamless and delivery was super fast! Less than a week! Setting up took less than 10 minutes. It does say it takes about 4-5 hours to set but I saw a complete difference within 24-48 hours. The mattress does have a new smell once opened. Let it air out for about 24 hours. Looking forward to more comfy sleeps!!,5,43991,Michelle,michelle.singh6@gmail.com,,,NO,

I told him that I am disabled and there is no way we could lift the box to upstairs and he should do so, I did not mind the dirt. He eventually got it up with another man and left the duvet in the landing and immediately left. Upon inspection the box was completely wet, torn and very muddy. It was NOT rainy that day.

Besides these we have been using the mattress for a month now, it is comfortable and it certainly reduced my lower back ache. It is firm which is good, but topping could have been softer. When lying on your side, it puts pressure to your hips. The problem we encountered is the smell!. It has been a month I have been airing the bed everyday and eventually, the chemical smell that comes out of it eventually subsided. In general I like the mattress.

Hence it shouldn't be that bad. We decided to change our mattress and it was a bit annoying trying to find a European queen size mattress. Simba has that option so we go for it. The first night I slept on it, I was not feeling much, it was just comfy. But after a month, I realized my headache is gone (I sleep on my back, without pillows, mostly one position all night long. I always suffered from headaches after I wake up). My husband also feels less pain in his body and sleeping deeper. Our sleeps are getting better day by day.

The mattress is amazing as expected- One bonus is it doesn’t have the chemically smell I remember from my first Simba mattress.

22004M,Rejuvenated,"For as long as i can remember I've suffered tremendously with lower and upper back pain, hip and waist pain, spinal and shoulder pain, legs and rib pain.
some pains and aches due to medical problems some due to sleeping on a mattress that wasn't suited for me.
id previously already spent a lot of money over the years on different mattresses from several different companies all claiming they could do the same thing.... restore and replenish..... revitalise and care for all areas of the body, take care of aches, pains, posture..... id become deflated and withered from having lost all faith in any mattress anyone had to offer and from throwing my money at companies for telling me what i wanted to hear but not for filling guarantees.
so when id heard about Simba i was reluctant to even check out their website let alone think of purchasing one, so as anyone does i rely on honest reviews from real genuine people and safe to say overlooked all the reviews on all mattresses they have to offer and with the information given plus to word of some very loyal friends i decided to take a leap and purchase a mattress.
the mattress came a day early (they'd let me know in advance, which i love) it had come in the morning so i opened it up and let it firm while i was out for six hours, when id come back it was time to place the mattress on the bedframe ( super easy to lift and shift). come bedtime i was cautious of the mattress so lowered myself slowly and didn't move, instantly i felt myself start to sink ever so slightly, not enough for it to swallow me whole but enough to lift any tension and dull aches and keep a nice light and even posture.
quicker than i have done in years i fell into the most subliminal sleep ever!!
i woke the next day and to my absolute surprise, for the first time in a long time i was awake properly ( in order for me to wake up properly when using other mattresses it would rely on a whole separate routine) but after one night the sheer miracle of waking up and feeling like i had an entirely new body.... i was beyond shocked, id already set myself up for being disappointed because its what i was used to as far as a decent mattress goes.
i stood from the bed within seconds.... no having to alter my body, no having to limit movement and get up a certain way due to the dull discomfort and pain id usually feel, again i was in complete shock, fast forward a week after having it i cant even remember how bad those problems used to feel anymore, my neck and shoulders.... limber not crooked or tense, my ribs.... pain free no bruising feel to them, my waist and hips..... light and tones of movement in them no dull pain, sharp shocks or stiffness, my spine and back........ FLEXIBLE!...... NO RESTRICTIONS!...... FREE MOVEMENT!...... NO PAIN WHAT SO EVER!
i was absolutely gobsmacked, i now place no limitations on how i move or the things i can do or have to worry about any consequences to do with current problems i have because there are none! 
( i sometimes wake with a stiff jaw but my pillows really need upgrading, also something I'm willing to purchase from Simba now)
coming home and going to bed used to be borderline depressing knowing i was going to wake up and feel worse than i did the day before... but now i come home and the excitement of knowing when i get into bed not only am i going to have no problem getting to sleep, I'm also going to wake up and feel BETTER than the day before is just overwhelming.
Simba managed to work wonders for me and have well and truly resorted my faith when it comes to making good on promises and guarantees and to top that off have sorted out years worth of torment, pain and discomfort to the point where I'm now such a happier and calmer person after getting what i need.
so if you are looking to purchase a mattress from them i fully encourage it, it will hands down be one of the best decisions you've ever made!
10/10 i cant compliment them or what have to offer enough!
i hope this helps if you're sceptical like i used to be &lt;3",5,44701,Mza A.,zayed5150@gmail.com,,,NO,

The fitted sheet not only stayed tucked, but never wrinkled or bunched up underneath us. These may be the softest, most luxurious sheets we have ever owned.

22HVLF,Sturdy,My daughter loves her new bed. It's good heavy material. Of course with any loft bed there will be some wobble but this one is pretty good. It's not concerning or wobbling even just turning in sleep. Creates great space for small room. The ladder is good sturdy one too. Only thing about that is if you are wearing socks it can be slippery.

You can kinda feel the springs and if you lay down on it too fast it has waaayy to much give, so you can feel the floor for a second. Sleeping in the middle is okay, but I saw my kid rolled off the side because there is zero firmness.

They were wrinkled out of the dryer so if you are someone who likes crisp sheets you will have to iron these. I don't ever iron my sheets as I don't have time so I don't know how they iron out. My older son quite liked them and said it was nice to switch things up. They were soft and comfortable to sleep on. My other son didn't even notice which I took to be a good sign as they likely felt soft, comfortable and worn in like his old ones. Best of all they are Canadian and organic!

However it will not work if you use a bed skirt as the Bloom Box is only about 7 1/2 inches in height in comparison to a regular boxspring that is around 9 1/2 inches. You use a frame or the legs that come with it but either way your bed will sit a few inches lower. The frustrating part I found was online staff told us that it was the same height as a regular boxspring.,4,43848,Shaun I.,imrie@shaw.ca,,,NO,

32M,Happy So Far But Still Not Sure it's Worth the Money,"We had to wait about 6 weeks for the Casper Wave Hybrid King Size mattress to be delivered, so we have only been sleeping on it for about a month. So far, we like it and have found it more comfortable than our previous mattress, which was a decent quality 7.5 year old mattress, so it needed to be replaced. Both of us have lower back pain and I would say the pain has lessened with the Wave Hybrid, and even if I move around (which I do constantly throughout the night), I can typically find another comfortable position fairly quickly and fall asleep again. On my previous mattress, I couldn't, so I was awake a lot during the night. The best part so far about the Wave Hybrid is that there is hardly any weight transfer when my husband moves. I used to wake up all the time, any time he got in and out of bed, rolled over or shifted. I had a hard time falling back asleep again, but with the Wave Hybrid, I hardly feel a thing when he moves - which means less interrupted sleep for me - big plus! 

Our biggest question mark is the longevity of the Wave Hybrid. Will this mattress last longer than a typical decent quality mattress (i.e. longer than about 7 years)? For the cost (equivalent of about CAD4,000), it's about 3x more expensive than a decent quality king mattress and about 2x more expensive than a better quality king sized mattress. Is it really worth the cost?? It's good so far (I would give it a 4 star for now, but for the remaining uncertainty since it's only been a month and the cost, I'm rating it a 3). We are not yet convinced that it's worth all of the hype or the cost.",3,44310,Debbie,debbie@gmail.com,,,NO,
32M,Better than I expected,"I was skeptical of the foam technology approach, but our daughter has a Casper and recommended it.

After several weeks we are still happy with the purchase.",5,44367,Eric,eric@gmail.com,,,NO,

I have had no pain at all since I have been sleeping on my Casper mattress and I have been sleeping so well for the past month. I opted for the additional 'Snow' to keep me cool at night.

I tend to sleep hot and the Snow cooling system makes a big difference. Even through summer nights I’ve been sleeping without overheating.

500E,Worth it with some hesitation,"On the positive - these sheets fit my king mattress perfectly and my husband loves that there is a tag indicating “head” and “foot” on the fitted sheet. No fighting getting over that last corner when making the bed and they need minimal adjustment in the morning. They have laundered really well with no indication of shrinkage, but have dried them on a medium heat setting. As others have said, there is a chemical smell that seems to have disappeared after the 3rd washing but it wasn’t pleasant, especially when taking them out of the dryer.

I’m still waiting for that “super soft buttery feel” that these promised but I know that comes with multiple laundering’s. I’m 4 launders in and they are still kinda stiff. If you like crisp, these are great. But I’m hoping for softer to come. Four star rating assuming they soften up because of the chemical odor.

My only question/concern is “what’s that smell?!”
Is it from the factory/warehouse that they are stored in? It’s been a week and is slowly starting to fade ~ but that first few nights when you lay your head down.., it’s pretty yucky. 
Great installation service ~ loving my new Milouf headboard/platform bed in the grey. Looks beautiful in the room! It was a big splurge ~ but definitely worth it as it will last a long time!

According to my FitBit I am sleeping better as well as it is showing a better sleep score. I definitely recommend this mattress and want to set a reminder to everyone that there is always a break in period.

It's just the right amount of firm. I can sleep on my side or back and either way, I wake up feeling ah-mazing. I also appreciate that this bed is more environmentally friendly as it uses plastic bottles to make up some of the material. Overall, if you're looking for a bed that's going to give you a great night's rest, then I highly reccomend this one. I had one of my family members come over and they slept on this bed, they said it was amazing.

82343M,After 14 nights of sleep,"After 14 nights of sleep on my new Beautyrest, I have so many positive things to say. When the mattress was first delivered, I was impressed by the premium look and feel. The overall experience is striking, with luxe fabrics and Seaqual branding. There is a beautiful chevron pattern to the pillow top, and the mattress even has handles for easy moving. This mattress is absolutely plush yet supportive, the definition of luxury. I am a side sleeper, my partner is a stomach sleeper, and on any given night we may have between 1-2 toddlers join us (anyone who sleeps with toddlers knows they are athletic sleepers with gymnastics to rival Simone Biles.) This mattress is suitable for all of us, and as a bonus we are much less aware of one another's movements. As an added perk, both my partner and I have noticed and appreciated the DualCool layers for temperature regulation. If I'm being nit picky (and for the sake of a thoroughly honest review, I will be) there are a couple of things I don't love about the Imperial Tide. That beautiful chevron pattern is noticeable against parts of my body that rest lightly on the surface (arms, feet) and given my own level of sensory sensitivity, I've had to put a flannel sheet under the fitted sheet on my side of the bed. This has eliminated the bothersome effect of the pattern, but does reduce the DualCool experience somewhat. My partner is an edge sleeper, and finds that the downside of the ultra-plush pillow top is it's tendency to collapse downward under him at the edge of the bed. These complaints are minor when considering the overall experience of the mattress, and would not deter us from purchasing this mattress in the future (we are already in talks of replacing our toddler's beds with Beautyrests). I am absolutely a lifetime convert to Beautyrest, and would recommend one to anyone looking for a better night's sleep.",4,44357,Anonymous,anonymous@example.com,,,NO,

The mattress is firm but plush at the same time. I'm usually a side sleeper, but I enjoy sleeping in any position with this design. Another thing I noticed, and liked, is there's a handle on the side of the bed which makes it very easy to move around and lift. I would have never known plastic water bottles were used make the luxurious material. I think it's great that BeautyRest is trying to make a difference in the environment by pulling plastic from the ocean and recycling it. The technology they used to design this mattress is amazing! Since I received the bed complimentary, I'm not sure of the exact price. However, when I looked it up online, it was a bit expensive. I definitely recommend the BeautyRest Imperial Tide Mattress.

As a single person manoeuvring a mattress is not necessarily an easy thing to do and I had no issues with this because it is that much lighter. So my biggest issue about mattresses is continuity. They tend to be amazing when you try them in the store and then you get them into your house and within six months you're sinking into the middle of them because the mattress isn't all that it's cracked up to be. I got to say so far this mattress is not disappointing me. I requested a firmer mattress and it's firm but it's comfortable. This mattress is showing me how insufficient my other mattress was, with this mattress I feel like every part of my body is being supported when I sleep no matter how much I toss and turn. I have jumped on this bed, i have read, watched, laughed and cried in this bed. I have spent 4 full days in this bed, I have done all the things one can do to test out a the quality of mattress. Because of Covid we're still in a phase where we're not allowed to have more than X amount of people in our homes so once that's lifted I am going to have at least five of my friends come hang out on the bed for a day. . The people that have been able to be in my home and are familiar with the previous mattress, which was not cheap and only 3 years old, all prefer this mattress. For the Last three weeks I have found myself waking up feeling much more rested, more jovial, and less anxious. In the next few weeks work depending on what my province decides to do with Covid I'm gonna have myself and another person come lay down and maybe take a nap and see how it distributes and supports two individuals who may not be of the same weight height and size but who share a mattress .

I have back problems and constantly suffer from lower back pain, so I was afraid it would be an issue, but I didn't feel any pain and woke up rested every time. Also, it does not sink in when you sit on it, making it ideal to sit on and watch tv, read or get some work done on your laptop. Plus, It does not overheat, keeping me comfortable the whole night.

It is the perfect softness for me, and does not take my body shape after awhile. It is so comfy and it has kept me from tossing and turning in my nights. I wake up feeling like I've had a great nights sleep every morning. Would 100% recommend this mattress if it is within your budget! Plus, it's not only made out of plastics from the ocean, it's antimicrobial, and designed for lumbar support. Amazing.",5,44358,Anonymous,anonymous@example.com,,,NO,
82363M,My first experience with this,"My first experience with this mattress, was it has handles! The greatest invention EVER! Especially when you're dealing with a king size mattress, which is awkward to begin with. My first night sleep, was not my favorite. I actually found the bed TOO firm for my liking. However, knowing that this was a medium firm bed, and considered plushon the beautyrest website, I wasn't ready to give up. I walked on my side of the mattress for about 5 minutes to break it in, and now I find it perfect! My husband however loves it more firm, and will let it break in naturally. This mattress definitely stays cool during the evening. I sleep with a duvet & a weighted blanket on, even in the summer, and do not overheat. Knowing the mattress is made sustainably, & uses recycled water bottles pulled from the ocean also helps me sleep better at night! Overall, very great mattress. Great for anyone with back pain, and anyone who likes a medium firm bed.",5,44347,Anonymous,anonymous@example.com,,,NO,

I move alot throughout the night, stomach, back and side and this pillow accommodates all positions. As well, it holds its form very well, so there is no fluffing or adjusting.

What it did was flatten to the point where my head (neck) was aligned with my shoulders. That said the next morning to my surprise, I experienced no neck pain as I usually do from my other pillow. It was the best nights sleep I've had in sometime. After using this pillow for a few nights I went back to my old pillow for a comparison. The following morning the neck pain was back and the sleep was terrible. This pillow lasted a few more days, the the new pillow was back for good.

If you're accustomed to sleeping with two pillows, firm pillows or whatever, give this pillow a try. You might be pleasantly surprised.",4,44240.71846,John W.,jw3730@execulink.com,,ECOM13960502,YES,Desktop

ACTCHARCOALPIL,Comfortable Pillow But Not for All Sleepers,When I first used this pillow it was with the Malouf pillow protector. My first impressions were this was the worst pillow ever!! It compressed under my head to a hard wedge and the sides wrapped around into my face making it hard to breathe. I am a side sleeper. The second pillow did not have the pillow protector on and by chance I used it the next night. It was a completely different pillow. I took the protector off the first pillow and tried it again. The pillow protector was the problem. It is so air tight that it adversely affects the pillow. The pillow has air holes that clearly need air to function properly. Do not buy the protectors. I wasted $90 on them and can’t get my money back because I opened the package. As far as I’m concerned the protectors are defective for use with this pillow and should be refundable. Now as to the pillow - it is soft and comfortable. I have bad arthritis in my neck and shoulders and felt no pressure points using the pillow. The only issue is that it is not thick enough for great side sleeping. It does compress and causes my neck to be slightly out of alignment. For comfortable sleep I have to lie partially on my back with my neck turned. Not ideal. It is okay to sleep on the side for shorter periods of time. It is definitely more comfortable that my old hard memory foam pillow. In conclusion this pillow may not be for ALL sleepers. But it is excellent for pressure relief.,3,44335.69167,Steve A.,s.anker@outlook.com,,ECOM15733176,YES,Mobile
ACTCHARCOALPIL,Great Fast Response Pillow,"My hunt for the perfect pillow is over! I never liked the traditional slow response memory foam pillows since it made me prone to neck strains so my eyes were set on a fast response pillow to alleviate that.

So, I decided to take a gamble after purchasing the previous pillows and try out these new charcoal pillows, which also came with added benefits such as being hypoallergenic.

I’ve had a bad neck since age 12 and it just got worse with over time...I finally decided to splurge on an expensive pillow and chose this one because of other reviews saying their neck pain was relieved. I was skeptical because I have always hated firm pillows, and I won’t lie it took about 2 weeks to get a good night sleep but once I adjusted I felt amazing.

I don't enjoy the stiffness of it and I now wake up with neck pain that I didn't have before. It's quite an expensive way to find out that it's just another pillow that didn't work. I gave it a 2 because it's not the worst pillow I've ever had, but I would never purchase one again or recommend it.",2,44229.7009,Caroline N.,carolinenevin@hotmail.com,,ECOM13663700,YES,Desktop
AQUAFIRM,It's okay if you only sleep on your side.,"I was experiencing shoulder and back pain, so decided to try a new pillow. Due to Covid, I had to rely on the sleep experts on the Sleep Country website. I told the experts that I am a side sleeper at the beginning of my slumber, but that I turn on to my back and stomach throughout the night. The expert recommended that I buy the side sleeper pillow. They said it would be perfect for me and my needs. After having used these pillows for several weeks, I do not agree. They are fine when I am on my side, but I am now waking up with different aches due to these pillows being too dense for my other sleeping postions (stomach, in particular). These pillows are not cheap, so I am disappointed with this purchase. On the plus side, the pillow is comfortably firm for my back when I am reading in bed. 😊 ",3,44246.88789,Carrie-Ann B.,carrie.ann.burgess@gmail.com,,ECOM14029869,YES,Mobile

Also very disappointed with customer service. We have purchased all of our mattresses at sleep country and I just purchased 4 sets of bamboo sheets. All very expensive and so I assumed the quality would be there. I used pillow covers thinking the policy was the same as the mattress, it is not. So now I have spent $800 on pillows that are garbage.

I love these sheets and will buy some for my other daughter-in-law and more for myself. They are well worth the price. I've done price comparisons and seen other bamboo sheets but these last, don't pill, and get softer over time. Be sure to wash in cold and take out of the dryer right away.

BB20,Amazing sheets!,"My brother-in-law raved about these sheets, and while I was a bit skeptical, when my wife and I recently upgraded to a king-size bed, we decided to get a set and give them a try. My goodness was it ever worth it! If anything, my brother-in-law undersold them. They are excellent sheets across the board. They feel extremely soft and light. They remain very cool during the night, which makes for very comfortable sleeps (even now as summer is starting ramp up). Even some of the minor touches are great. The fitted sheet comes with little inner labels at the head and the foot, so you can easily tell how to orient the sheets. It's a minor thing, but it is a nice touch.

BB20,So soft and comfortable,"I loved these sheets from the moment I crawled into bed. They are probably the most comfortable sheets I have ever slept between. I definitely recommend them for some. I bought these sheets because within the last 2 years my partner has become a very sweaty sleeper. I read bamboo sheets were not only soft but keep you cooler during the night, and would help with his problem. If that is what you are looking for, these will not help. They are no more cooling then regular sheets. I only have a few notes to potential buyers. I bought the white ones and they are very sheer, I can see through to my mattress which may bother some. I also find even with the very thick sturdy looking elastic it starts to bulge out of the sides making it not as tight or esthetically pleasing as I would like, I find I am adjusting this often. They also wrinkle very easily and started to pill around the feet within first week of using them. If none of this would bother you then I would defiantly recommend because they are like sleeping inside a cloud.",3,44221,Nikola D.,nikola.davison@hotmail.com,,,NO,

The elastic in the fitted sheet is not covered by fabric, and one of each pillow case sets has a gap/hole in the seam where the fabric has frayed.

BIOGREEN,Wonderful pillows,"However the name of the pillows are not what the store people use. Eg. Bio-Soy is what I wanted to order, and the clerk kept repeating “Bio-green”. Then when I dug a little deeper with a different clerk who was a better communicator, I discovered that I actually wanted Bio-Soft. It seems that although I’m a side sleeper, in pillow jargon that supposedly means you want a firm pillow. But I’m also a burrower so the “Bio-Soft” was perfect. I bought 2 for my guest room and another 2 for my room.

The darker grey is lovely as well (we saw it in the store). The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is that the hardware that attaches the base to the headboard is black, and is visible when assembled. It's not the most attractive bracket, as it's quite large. This platform base and headboard only come in grey (whether a bit darker or lighter), so why not use a grey coated bracket??? It would blend in SO much better! It's not a huge deal or a dealbreaker, but it would look so much better if it was grey!

One thing to mention- it is exceptionally heavy. If you live in an apartment you will definitely need at least two adults to 1) get it inside your apartment and 2) be able to assemble it. It needs to be lifted up when the legs of the base are assembled so as not to put too much pressure on each leg, so this requires some strength and two people.

It is a good height which allows for storage underneath. Only detail I don't love is that there are two leg posts in the middle under the bed. It's obviously to help with support but the underbed storage boxes I have are now too big to fit underneath because the middle posts get in the way.

DAKPLT,Terrible experience,"I never write reviews but after my experience today with my drop off I'm left speechless. I opt'd for in home delivery without setup as I'm by myself in a basement rental with 2 steps of stairs and I just needed help to get it in the door. It could be halfway through and I would have been happy. I ordered a Soho platform bed which is pretty dang heavy. When the delivery truck arrived I greeted them and as they were taking my item out of the back of the truck, they dropped my item to the ground from about 2 feet in the air while he waited for the other worker to return to help. As they proceed to bring it into the property they dropped it again from about 1 foot in the air onto the ground to re-grip, and then when they got to my door they just dropped it again by the wall next to my door and proceeds to say right here is good. Each time it was dropped I watched it bounce and was extremely upset as it could have damaged my bed frame. Since the guy was in a rush and refused to at least just bring it into the door way for me I had to leave my order outside in the rain for 1 hour until I could randomly find help from my neighbour. Terrible experience with whoever you guys are using to help deliver your orders. Why even give me the option of contactless or in-home when they aren't going to help anyways.

The quality is second to none. My only suggestion would be for a tidier closure on the duvet cover - either more buttons or a zipper - an option for wooden buttons would be fantastic. Although they are quite wrinkled right out of the dryer, the wrinkles become less apparent once the sheets/duvet rest on the bed. The fitted sheet fits incredibly well, and fits right under the mattress so it doesn't pop off the corners. The order was delivered within three days of placing the order.

I've traveled across the world and stayed in some pretty luxurious hotels. Every time I returned home, I always thought, ""Where the heck do they get their sheets?"" to replicate that 5-star hotel experience. Well friends, look no further. I have the Sand color in the King set and we love the soft white color and fits our mattress perfectly (not too tight and not too loose that the corners come off).

They are so soft yet thick but also maintain an amazing crispness between washings, which is very hard to find in sheets. I've never slept better in my life and would never go back to cheap sheets again. As well, this company's customer service is incredible - when I reached out about a very minor imperfection in one of the pillow cases, no questions were asked and a replacement set was sent to me within a few days. On top of their linens being the best thing ever and their great customer service, they donate to provide bed kits to children.

We have not had to remove any of the cubes as it seems to be fine just the way it is.

PILSIMB,Amazing design,"I had to remove half of the little cubes as I like a flat pillow. I was also pretty shocked that you can’t even feel the little cubes at all, it feels like a regular pillow (When you first unpack it it feels lumpy but don’t worry, the cubes fluff up and even out). I think the outer layer is my favourite though as I get very hot while sleeping and I love the cooling side. Whatever it is made out of is so cool to the touch, It’s amazing. It almost feels like you put your pillow in the fridge. I was used to a memory foam gel pillow so the spongey cubes took a little getting used to as it is a different level of firmness but I would say this pillow is worth it as it meets the needs of sooooo many people.",5,44458.55626,Lisa T.,lt013@hotmail.com,,ECOM17892931,YES,Tablet

It's much larger than some of the compact sizes offered in the USA that Sleep Country has yet to bring to Canada (hint hint, Sleep Country team!) but I'm glad I have this and it's well worth the value.

But I'm too cheap and don't want to spring for an expensive office chair, and I don't have a lot of space for a bulky chair anyway. I had read about the Purple cushion on The Strategist and was intrigued by the purple grid design, so I figured why not? I bought it and it's been awesome, very cushiony and supportive and cool because of the grid - it never loses its shape and you can sit on it for hours comfortably. You can put it on any chair that has a wide-enough seat, or even the floor, and it makes it comfortable. I plan to take it with me on a road trip to Quebec and I'm sure it will make the drive much more enjoyable.

WOOL,Your Customer Service sucks!,"My first call with Customer Service, I was told by this lady (stupid mistake for not getting her name) that I will be emailed by her manager the return shipping label so just wait for it. She said only her manager can do it. Few days after, I have not received it yet. I called again. Spoke to a Tatiana. She said there was no record of my call, there was no shipping label created, nothing was done. Like I never called. I explained the issue all over again. She said she has to transfer me to Sales Dept for the return label. I spoke to Colin. I again explained the issue to him because Tatiana just cold transferred me without proper handover. Colin said Sales Dept can't make a return label. Only Customer Service can. I was again transferred but this time line ""got disconnected"" when someone answered. Frustrated, upset, furious - I called again. Spoke to Sheila. She was the only person who actually helped me. She made the return label and emailed it to me. She made sure I got it before ending the call and she confirmed Customer Service agents can make and send the return label.

So to whoever I spoke with first who did nothing not even putting comments about my call, and to Tatiana who did not know what to do, both of you are very unhelpful (i am going for useless but that would he harsh). Try to get proper training from Sheila or others who actually knows what they are doing.

It has been over a week since they confirmed receipt of the item, I have not receive my refund yet. Will wait for another week and will again call your useless line.",1,44192.79427,Jinky S.,nyssa_8@yahoo.com,,ECOM12357308,YES,Mobile

I have tried to add different blankets to insulate myself and my partner. However, therre are no fixings for flat sheets so the move and the blankets move . I would suggest a clip ( 4 ) each side to hold blankets or sheets to insulate the airbag.
